# Flatdango

Flatdango is a movie theater app that displays movies the theater is showcasing on a particular day.

The movie that shows when a user enters the site is the top trending movie of the season.

A user should be able to:

View a list of movies showing.
Click on a movie from the list and:
See the poster.
See the runtime.
See the showtime.
See the tickets remaining.
Buy a ticket for the movie.
Requirements
Web browser of choice, preferably Chrome.

# Running

Click on a movie title to see the movie poster, showtime, runtime, description, and available tickets.

You can buy a ticket by clicking on the "Buy Ticket" button.

A "Sold Out" badge will be displayed next to the movie's title in the movie list menu when it's sold out, and users can't buy tickets anymore.
